# Two-Window Branch Precomputation Pipeline Simulator

This project implements a **custom MIPS-like 5-stage pipelined processor simulator** in Python with a novel **two-instruction branch precomputation unit (BPU)** designed to reduce branch penalty latency by evaluating up to two branch instructions before the decode stage.
